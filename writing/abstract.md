## Flow asymmetry over varying topography: Implications for large-scale circulation 

Ocean flows interacting with topography are critical for shaping large-scale 
circulation in polar regions such as the Arctic Ocean, where strong topographic 
steering shapes flow along continental slopes. Flow over sloping topography with
corrugations exhibits an asymmetric response to prograde versus retrograde 
forcing, with stronger and more laminar flows in the prograde case (here, 
prograde forcing aligns with topographic wave propagation, while retrograde 
forcing opposes it). Previous studies attribute this asymmetry to increased 
topographic form stress for retrograde forcing. To further investigate these 
dynamics, we analyze flow responses to time-variable forcing over corrugated 
slopes using momentum budgets along depth-following contours. In this framework,
the topographic form stress term vanishes, and vorticity fluxes across
depth-contours emerge as the dominant mechanism driving asymmetries. 

Preliminary results from idealized shallow water simulations reveal distinct 
nonlinear flow behaviors. For shorter forcing periods, the flow exhibits a 
cyclonic shift consistent with the "Neptune effect." For longer forcing periods, 
retrograde flow strength saturates, plateauing even as forcing increases. 
These findings build on our previous analysis of a realistic Arctic Ocean 
simulation, which indicated that these nonlinear effects leave an imprint 
on large-scale circulation. Together, they suggest that mesoscale topography-flow 
interactions modulate large-scale circulation and contribute to temporal 
variability in polar oceans under changing forcing conditions.
