The interaction of ocean flows with topography is a key process influencing large-scale circulation, particularly in regions like the Arctic Ocean, where strong topographic steering shapes flow along continental slopes. Previous studies have demonstrated that flow over sloping topography with corrugations exhibits an asymmetric response to prograde versus retrograde forcing, with stronger and more laminar flows typically observed in the prograde case (prograde forcing refers to flow aligned with the propagation of topographic waves, whereas retrograde forcing opposes this propagation). These studies often attribute the asymmetry to increased topographic form stress for retrograde forcing. To better understand these dynamics, we investigate flow responses to time-variable forcing over corrugated slopes, focusing on momentum budgets along depth-following contours. Our approach highlights the role of vorticity fluxes across depth-contours, which replace topographic form stress as the dominant mechanism driving asymmetries.

Preliminary results from idealized shallow water simulations confirm the expected asymmetric response and reveal two distinct flow behaviors. For shorter forcing periods, the flow exhibits a cyclonic shift consistent with theoretical predictions such as the "Neptune effect." For longer forcing periods, retrograde flow strength saturates, plateauing even as forcing increases. Vorticity fluxes are predominantly positive, resulting in the cyclonic shift and saturation of retrograde flow strength for anticyclonic forcing.

Our findings provide a novel framework for understanding flow asymmetries over sloped topography, demonstrating how mesoscale topography-flow interactions influence large-scale circulation. Future work will aim to deepen understanding of the interplay between vorticity dynamics and time-variable forcing, particularly in relation to large-scale oceanographic processes.
